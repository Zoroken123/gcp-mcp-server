## Introduction

The GCP MCP Server serves as a central hub for integrating various GCP services, including BigQuery, Vertex AI, and other essential tools. This project aims to simplify the development process for AI applications by providing a unified platform that adheres to the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Features

- **Seamless GCP Integration**: Connect effortlessly with GCP services to enhance your AI applications.
- **Support for Multiple AI Agents**: Deploy and manage various AI agents within the same environment.
- **Data Handling with BigQuery**: Utilize BigQuery for efficient data storage and querying.
- **Robust Infrastructure**: Built on a solid foundation to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Easy Setup**: Get started quickly with clear installation instructions.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform**: The backbone of the server, providing scalable resources.
- **BigQuery**: For handling large datasets and performing complex queries.
- **Vertex AI**: To manage and deploy machine learning models effectively.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Ensures structured communication between AI agents and the server.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for the server.
- **Express.js**: For building web applications and APIs.

## Installation

To set up the GCP MCP Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zoroken123/gcp-mcp-server.git
   cd gcp-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use npm to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Google Cloud Credentials**:

   Ensure you have a Google Cloud account and set up your credentials. You can follow the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for guidance.

4. **Run the Server**:

   Start the server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will now be running on your local machine.

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests. The API provides endpoints for managing AI agents, querying data from BigQuery, and integrating with Vertex AI.

### Example API Request

To add a new AI agent, send a POST request to the `/agents` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/agents -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Agent1", "type": "chatbot"}'
```

### Documentation

For detailed API documentation, refer to the `docs` folder in the repository. It contains examples, endpoint descriptions, and usage scenarios.
